The demo of Arduino UNO showcases the versatility and potential of the popular microcontroller platform. The demo includes three applications: blinkingLed, button_led, and irremote. The blinkingLed application demonstrates how to control an LED to blink at a regular interval using the Arduino UNO board. The button_led application shows how to use a push button to control an LED, where the LED turns on and off when the button is pressed and released, respectively. The irremote application demonstrates how to use the infrared remote control to send signals to the Arduino board, allowing the board to control various devices such as TVs or sound systems. Overall, the demo highlights the ease of use and flexibility of the Arduino UNO platform.
